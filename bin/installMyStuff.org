* [10/12] [83%] Install My github repos to make a new system functional
   This installs my common things from github on a new system.

   Some of these are in [[https://github.com/eludom/chef/tree/master/cookbooks][my chef cookboks]].  All of this should probably
   migrate there once I've worked it out here in a more manual
   fashion. 
** DONE First, set up babel to execute the rest

   I tend to organize things and run them as [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/][emacs org-babel]] blocks.
   This does minimal setup to to enable that.  The shell commands below
   can be run by hand (not as org-bable souce blocks)

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :exports code
    (org-babel-do-load-languages
        'org-babel-load-languages '((python . t) (sh . t) (lisp . t) (R . t) (ditaa . t)))
    (setq org-export-babel-evaluate nil)
    (setq org-confirm-babel-evaluate nil)
    (setq org-babel-sh-command "bash")
    #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
    : bash

** DONE Make sure we are root   
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh  :results output :exports both  :dir /sudo::
   exec 2>&1;set -e; set -u; set +x; echo '#' `date;`
   whoami
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   : # Sat Jan 30 09:11:32 UTC 2016
   : root

** DONE Update the system
   Assume ubuntu for the moment.

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh  :results output :exports both  :dir /sudo::
   exec 2>&1;set -e; set -u; set +x; echo '#' `date;`
   apt-get update -y
   apt-get upgrade -y
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
