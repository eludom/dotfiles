#+TITLE: George Jones's dotfiles and installation script
#+DATE: <2015-06-06 06:45:34 Saturday>

- dotfiles :: in this context means "non-sensitive configuration
     data" that will likely be generic across all my environments 

As opposed to 

- configs :: which means "non-sensitive configuration data that is
     probably specific to me, e.g. the names of my blogs,
     environmentally specific (work vs home) shell aliases etc."

and

- secrets :: which means "sensitive configuration data that is no
     suitable for public consumption", e.g. things like ssh
     credentials, passwords, etc.

These dotfiles are intended to work independent of configs and secrets.

* Action Items
** TODO Make repos match above description
** TODO merge .emacs.d and elisp into dotfiles
** TODO move .gitconfig to configs
