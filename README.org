#+TITLE: George Jones's dotfiles and supporting code

"dotfiles" in this context mean "non-sensitive configuration data"
that is probably specific to me, e.g. the names of my blogs, shell
aliases etc.

This is as opposed to "secrets" which are things like ssh credentials,
~/.authinfo files (technically a "dotfile") etc.

Things in my main configs (~/.emacs.d and ~/elisp) are ment for
general consumption.   

Things in my dotfiles are not particularly sensitive, but will change
from environment to environment (home, work).

Thinks in secrets are sensitive and will also change from environment
to environment.

* Action Items
** Make repos match above description
   - .emacs.d and elisp on github
   - dotfiles on github
   - secrets as private repos "elsewhere"

** Make install.sh scripts for all environments to install things as symlinks
   e.g.

   ~/.ssh/config -> ~/git/${whereever}/${user}/.ssh/config
