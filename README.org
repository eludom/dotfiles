#+TITLE: George Jones's dotfiles and installation script
#+DATE: <2016-02-23 04:59:42 Tuesday>

This directory contains my generic dotfiles (.bashrc, etc) and (for
historical reasons) my misc homegrown ~/bin/ utilities.

- Install with install.sh

- Project file (TODO'S etc) in project-dotfiles.org
