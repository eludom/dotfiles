#+TITLE: George Jones's dotfiles and installation script
#+DATE: <2016-02-13 11:59:55 Saturday>

This directory contains (for historical reasons) my misc homegrown
~/bin/ utilities and my generic dotfiles (.bashrc, etc)

They should be installed using the (in this order)

  bin/install.sh
  install.sh
